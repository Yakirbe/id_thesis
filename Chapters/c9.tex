We propose a new embedding method for a single vector and for a pair
of vectors. This embedding method enables: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item efficient classification and regression of functions of single vectors
	\item efficient approximation of distance functions
	\item general, non-Euclidean, semimetric learning
\end{enumerate}.
The best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables learning any general, non-Euclidean, semimetrics.\\ 
That is, our method is a universal semimetric learning and approximation method that can approximate any distance function with as high accuracy as needed with or without semimetric constraints.\\
In this work, we have displayed a detailed exploration of our $ID$ method, describing its basic classification/regression algorithmic flow for single objects / object pairs.
